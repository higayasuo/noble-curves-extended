/**
 * When Weierstrass curve has `a=0`, it becomes Koblitz curve.
 * Koblitz curves allow using **efficiently-computable GLV endomorphism ψ**.
 * Endomorphism uses 2x less RAM, speeds up precomputation by 2x and ECDH / key recovery by 20%.
 * For precomputed wNAF it trades off 1/2 init time & 1/3 ram for 20% perf hit.
 *
 * Endomorphism consists of beta, lambda and splitScalar:
 *
 * 1. GLV endomorphism ψ transforms a point: `P = (x, y) ↦ ψ(P) = (β·x mod p, y)`
 * 2. GLV scalar decomposition transforms a scalar: `k ≡ k₁ + k₂·λ (mod n)`
 * 3. Then these are combined: `k·P = k₁·P + k₂·ψ(P)`
 * 4. Two 128-bit point-by-scalar multiplications + one point addition is faster than
 *    one 256-bit multiplication.
 *
 * where
 * * beta: β ∈ Fₚ with β³ = 1, β ≠ 1
 * * lambda: λ ∈ Fₙ with λ³ = 1, λ ≠ 1
 * * splitScalar decomposes k ↦ k₁, k₂, by using reduced basis vectors.
 *   Gauss lattice reduction calculates them from initial basis vectors `(n, 0), (-λ, 0)`
 *
 * Check out `test/misc/endomorphism.js` and
 * [gist](https://gist.github.com/paulmillr/eb670806793e84df628a7c434a873066).
